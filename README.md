# Web Scraper

The purpose of this project is to web scrape the text information of articles from a chosen website. For this project I chose to scrape The Onion in order to get a diverse assortment of text. Once the data is gathered, it is cleaned, lemmatized, and stop words are removed. A word cloud is created as well as a graph with the most commonly used words. Sentiment analysis using Textblob is also used on each article in order to see what the mood is for each individual article, finally telling what the overall mood of the scanned articles is.
